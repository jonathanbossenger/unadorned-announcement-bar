# Unadorned Announcement Bar

A companion plugin for the [How to use WordPress React components for plugin pages](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/03/26/how-to-use-wordpress-react-components-for-plugin-pages/) article.

## Setup

The build files are not included in the repository.

To build the assets, you have to install the dependencies and run the build script.
You can do this by running the following commands:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

For convenience, a [`wp-env`](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/03/quick-and-easy-local-wordpress-development-with-wp-env/) config is provided, so you can start a local environment with the plugin installed and activated, just by running:
```shell
npx wp-env start
```
